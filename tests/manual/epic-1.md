# Epic 1 — Customer walks CU-1

## Read this first

The walker is the **owner**, as the customer. **This is a chat test only** (owner ruling): the speed
test belongs to Epic 2, the video, and is not walked here. Written before the build, from the flow page
[[CU-1]] and the Loop 2c walk records (`prototypes/walks/`), whose control labels and landings were
proven in a browser against the prototype.

> **Every action goes through a real surface.** No direct API call, no database client, no seed
> script. **If something cannot be done from a surface, that is a FINDING** — write it down and
> move on.

> A terminal used to **measure** is allowed, and is named in the step table. A terminal used to
> **achieve** a product outcome is a **FINDING**.

## § 0 — Cold start and hazards

**Readiness:** *Epic 0 of 3 built · 0 signed* — this is Epic 1 of 3, the first; no dry-walk record
exists yet (the dry-walk result file under `memory/project/results/` is written by the build).

The cold start is taken from `memory/product/profile.md` § Cold start **once the build fills it**;
until then this section names what the build must make true. Paths are absolute.

* **Agent runs**: nothing destructive — the app has no database. It deletes
  `/Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev/var/sessions/*` (session snapshots; nothing
  else lives there) and confirms `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present in
  `/Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev/.env` **without printing it**. It also runs
  the two measurements below (0.a, 0.b) and reads them out.
* **You run, in your own terminal**:
  `cd /Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev && python3.11 -m app` *(the exact command
  is filled by Story 1.1; this is the shape)*. It refuses to start without a key, makes its warm-up
  call, and prints the local address.
* **Ready when**: the terminal prints `ready · warm-up 200 · http://127.0.0.1:8765` (the exact
  line is set by Story 1.1) and the page shows the greeting with three buttons and the key-info
  block at zero.

| Step | Action | Command / Where | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.a | 🤖 💻 Measure: the repo publishes nothing it should not | `cd /Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev && git status --short --ignored \| grep -E '^\?\?' ; git check-ignore -v .env var/sessions/probe 2>/dev/null` | No `??` line; `.env` and `var/` reported ignored (NFR1, NFR8, NFR10) |
| 0.b | 🤖 💻 Measure: the key is in no served or committed file | `cd /Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev && python3 -c "import re,subprocess;k=re.search(r'OPENROUTER_API_KEY=(\S+)',open('.env').read()).group(1);print(subprocess.run(['grep','-rl','--exclude-dir=.git','--exclude=.env','--exclude-dir=var',k,'.'],capture_output=True,text=True).stdout or 'clean')"` | `clean` (AC-8) |

| Hazard | What goes wrong |
|---|---|
| Every typed turn is a paid call to Jev | About 16 typed turns in this walk ≈ $0.003 against the owner's $1.00 cap |
| Jev unreachable (E-002), the spend cap, expiry | Not walked by the owner. Proven by the agent in Story 1.6's rehearsal — a dead address for one turn, a lowered cap, a shortened timeout — recorded in the dry-walk file. Stated here so they are not mistaken for walked |
| Jev's API can return empty answers (S-3 saw 57 in a row) | The turn shows MODEL FAILED and nothing else changes; that is the designed behaviour, not a finding — unless the order changed |

## § 1 — The bot leads: greeting to a confirmed order

**Preconditions as data:** a fresh session — the greeting is the only bubble, the key-info block
reads `— · ฿0.000 · 0`, no panel rows.

`Executed: [ ]  ·  Result: [ ]`

| Step | Action | Command / Where | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | 👤 🌐 Click **ช่วยแนะนำหน่อย** | the page | Your click echoed with *clicked · no model call*; Beanly asks how you brew; four buttons. No panel row |
| 1.2 | 👤 🌐 Type **ทำลาเต้ที่บ้านค่ะ ชอบคั่วกลาง**, Enter | composer | Composer shows *Beanly กำลังคิด…* then a row: `inform`, values `brew espresso_milk · roast medium`, a confidence, ms, ฿ and $. Beanly recommends two products, story first; buttons name them |
| 1.3 | 👤 🌐 Type **ตัวแรกค่ะ** | composer | The card of the **first** product Beanly named; row `select_option` with the product; if Jev did not name it, a provenance line says where it came from |
| 1.4 | 👤 🌐 Click **เอาตัวนี้** | the page | Beanly asks how many bags; buttons 1 · 2 · 3 · 5 ถุง |
| 1.5 | 👤 🌐 Click **2 ถุง** | the page | If a promotion fits (House Blend → 30 baht off at 6): offered once with *ไม่ urgent น้า*; otherwise the payment question |
| 1.6 | 👤 🌐 Click **ไม่เป็นไร เอาเท่าเดิม** (if offered) | the page | Beanly states the shipping fee and asks how to pay |
| 1.7 | 👤 🌐 Type **โอนเอาค่ะ** | composer | Row `inform · payment transfer`; Beanly asks for name, address, phone and says made-up details are fine |
| 1.8 | 👤 🌐 Type a fictional name, address and phone | composer | The read-back shows **your text**; the panel row reads `[delivery details]`; the order table has one line, shipping, total in bold |
| 1.9 | 🤖 💻 Measure: the address is held only in `delivery_text` — not in the log, not in any request | `cd /Users/dong/src/gig_demo/Scripted-Chatbot-with-Jev && python3 -c "import json,glob,os;f=max(glob.glob('var/sessions/*.json'),key=os.path.getmtime);d=json.load(open(f));a=d['order']['delivery_text'];s=json.dumps(d['log'],ensure_ascii=False);print('delivery_text set:',bool(a),'| in log:',(a[:12] in s) if a else None,'| masked entries:',s.count('[delivery details]'))"` | `delivery_text set: True \| in log: False \| masked entries: 1` (NFR10). The agent runs it; the walker does not retype the address |
| 1.10 | 👤 🌐 Click **ยืนยัน** | the page | Order code `BEAN-YYMM-####`; only **เริ่มใหม่** live. Key-info: **AVG RESPONSE** a few hundred ms, **TOTAL COST** ≈ 4 turns × $0.000165 × the rate, **TOTAL TURNS** 10. The panel header shows `jev-1.13`, `● live`, and the rate with its date (FR13, FR14, NFR3) |
| 1.11 | 👤 🌐 Click **open** on the newest panel row | the page | The viewer: what was sent (`shop_said`, `customer_said`, `awaiting`, `history`), what came back (with `t_sent → t_received` to the millisecond), what the bot did. **It does not cover the key-info block** |
| 1.12 | 👤 🌐 Reload the page | browser | **The same conversation is back** — transcript, dead buttons, rows, key-info unchanged (FR25) |
| 1.13 | 🤖 💻 then 👤 🌐 Stop the server (Ctrl-C in its terminal), start it again with the same command, reload | terminal, browser | **The same conversation is back from its snapshot** — the restart half of FR25 |

## § 2 — The customer leads: one sentence

**Preconditions as data:** a fresh session — reached by **typing** `เริ่มใหม่` (the intent, FR9), not the button.

`Executed: [ ]  ·  Result: [ ]`

| Step | Action | Command / Where | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | 👤 🌐 Type **เอาเอสเปรสโซ่คั่วเข้ม 3 ถุง เก็บปลายทางนะครับ** | composer | One row with three values: product KBN-002, quantity 3, payment cod. Beanly echoes them and offers the promotion that fits |
| 2.2 | 👤 🌐 Type **ไม่ครับ** | composer | Beanly skips straight to delivery details |
| 2.3 | 👤 🌐 Click **ใช้ข้อมูลตัวอย่าง** | the page | Read-back: 3 × 380 + 100 shipping + 30 COD = **1,270** |
| 2.4 | 👤 🌐 Type **โอเคครับ เอาตามนี้เลย** | composer | Order code — four typed turns |
| 2.5 | 👤 🌐 Click **เริ่มใหม่**, then click **มีโปรอะไรบ้าง** | the page | The four promotions listed, no model call; then click **ดูเมล็ดทั้งหมด** → the three roasters (FR2's other two greeting buttons) |

## § 3 — A question in the middle, and a change at the end

**Preconditions as data:** a fresh session (click **เริ่มใหม่**).

`Executed: [ ]  ·  Result: [ ]`

| Step | Action | Command / Where | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.0 | 👤 🌐 Type **ช่วยแนะนำหน่อยค่ะ**, then **ดริปค่ะ**, then **คั่วอ่อน** | composer | Beanly asks brew, then roast — the lead in the SOP's order (FR2) — then recommends **เกอิชา** and **วอชด์ อาราบิก้า** (filter + light) |
| 3.1 | 👤 🌐 Type **ตัวแรกค่ะ**, then **เอาค่ะ** | composer | The Geisha card; then the quantity question. `เอาค่ะ` is a `matched affirm` — not a fallback |
| 3.2 | 👤 🌐 Type **ค่าส่งเท่าไหร่คะ** | composer | The prepared shipping answer, **then the quantity question again**; the order unchanged |
| 3.3 | 👤 🌐 Type **1 ถุงค่ะ** | composer | Row `inform · by state (awaiting quantity)`, quantity 1 on the Geisha line — provenance says the product came from context. The Geisha + Natural Anaerobic promotion is offered |
| 3.4 | 👤 🌐 Type **ตอนนี้สั่งอะไรไปบ้างคะ** | composer | `view_order`: the order so far — one Geisha line — and the quantity is not re-asked (FR24) |
| 3.4b | 👤 🌐 Click the promotion, click **เก็บเงินปลายทาง**, click **ใช้ข้อมูลตัวอย่าง** | the page | Read-back with two lines, the 80-baht discount, COD fee |
| 3.5 | 👤 🌐 Type **ขอเปลี่ยนเป็น 3 ถุงค่ะ** | composer | The **Geisha** line becomes 3 — no new line; the order is read back again with the new total |
| 3.5b | 👤 🌐 Type **เดี๋ยวก่อนนะ ขอคิดดูก่อน** | composer | `deny` under the read-back: Beanly asks what to change, without pressing; the order stands (CU-1's hesitation branch) |
| 3.6 | 👤 🌐 Click **ยืนยัน** | the page | Order code |

## § 4 — When Jev does not understand

**Preconditions as data:** a fresh session.

`Executed: [ ]  ·  Result: [ ]`

| Step | Action | Command / Where | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | 👤 🌐 Type **มีหน้าร้านไหมคะ** | composer | A **FALLBACK** row (intent `none` or a low-confidence pick, shown); Beanly apologises and shows the same buttons; nothing else changes |
| 4.2 | 👤 🌐 Type **รับสมัครพนักงานไหมครับ** | composer | The second apology and the help buttons |
| 4.3 | 👤 🌐 Type **เอาเฮาส์เบลนด์ 2 ถุงค่ะ**, then **ยกเลิกออเดอร์ค่ะ** | composer | A line is added, then `cancel_order` clears it: Beanly confirms, no order remains, the greeting-style buttons return (FR24) |

## Findings

| # | Step | What happened | Class | Routed to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W-1 | off-runbook, after the greeting's **มีโปรอะไรบ้าง** click | Walker: *"values=roast light, FALLBACK · product_info; but bot still reply ขอโทษด้วยน้า แอดยังจับไม่ได้ว่าหมายถึงแบบไหน ลองพิมพ์อีกครั้งได้ไหมคะ?"* Typed **มีแบบคั่วอ่อนไม๊**. Log: `outcome fallback`, Jev `product_info` **0.41** (under the 0.45 threshold), `roast: light` read, `applied: []`, no pending prompt. The catalogue's `browse_catalog` has the example *มีเมล็ดคั่วเข้มตัวไหนบ้างคะ* (roast dark) and answers "only the matching products" | Walker's ruling: *"work as intented, it just need more intent to make chat more realistic"* — an improvement, not a defect. Same shape again: **มีแบบเปรี้ยวๆไม๊** → `ask_recommendation` 0.42 → fallback | *(at triage)* |
| W-2 | § 1 — the brew question (after **มีอะไรแนะนำบ้าง**; walk 1.1's buttons) | Walker: *"you must not put multiple option in same bullet eg [เอสเปรโซ่ หรือ นม] just separate it clearly"*. The built buttons are the `brew` entity's descriptions for Jev, used as labels: **ชงเอสเปรสโซ่ หรือทำเมนูนม เช่น ลาเต้ คาปูชิโน่** · **ดริป pour-over เฟรนช์เพรส โมก้าพอต หรือกาแฟดำแบบ filter** · **โคลด์บรูว์ หรือกาแฟสกัดเย็น** (`app/turn.py:310` `option_buttons(flow, "brew")`). The prototype drew four short ones (`prototypes/assets/shared.js:184`: เอสเปรสโซ่ / เมนูนม · ดริป / pour-over · โคลด์บรูว์ · ยังไม่แน่ใจ) — so the dry walk's 1.1 *three, not four* (F-13) is a divergence from the design of record, not a runbook error | wrong on screen *(proposed)* | *(at triage)* |

## Sign-off

`Walked: [ ]  ·  by: ______  ·  date: ______  ·  Result: ______`

## Deltas

Appended by Story 1.6's dry walk (2026-09-23, `memory/project/results/walk-dry-epic-1.md`). No row
above was edited; findings F-13 and F-2 carry the corrections to `orb4b-triage`.

- **The port (F-2):** 8765 and 8766 are held by other processes on this machine. Start with
  `PORT=8768 python3.11 -m app` and walk `http://127.0.0.1:8768`; the ready line then reads
  `ready · warm-up 200 · http://127.0.0.1:8768`. `.env` holds only the key today — add
  `THB_PER_USD` and `RATE_DATE` there, or pass them in the environment, or the cold start refuses.
- **1.9's count:** `masked entries` is **1 + the failed calls** on the session. A typed address whose
  call fails (MODEL FAILED, or the cap) is masked too (Story 1.5, F-8), so a session with two failed
  address turns reads `masked entries: 3`. On a clean path it is 1, as the row says.
- **32 step rows, not 31:** § 4 has three (4.1–4.3); the Epic's Walkability counted two.
- **1.1:** the brew question has **three** buttons, not four (the catalogue's `brew` options).
- **1.10:** TOTAL TURNS reads **9** on the path above (5 clicks + 4 typed). The model id `jev-1.13`
  in the panel header is light-on-light and hard to read (F-10, open).
- **2.1:** the row carries **five** values — Jev also reads `brew espresso_milk · roast dark` off the
  product's name; the three the row names are all there.
- **3.6:** after 3.5b's hesitation the reply offers เปลี่ยนสินค้า · เปลี่ยนจำนวน · เปลี่ยนวิธีชำระ and
  the read-back's **ยืนยัน** is no longer live (the prototype does the same). **Type ยืนยันค่ะ** — it
  is a matched `affirm` and gives the order code.
